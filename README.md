ModFrame is a modular MVC template for visual studio 2017 which allows easy seperation and management of layouts, modules, styles and scripts. ModFrame is based on ASP.NET Core MVC and has built in support for on the fly minification and concatenation of your CSS and JS files.

Note: The core version is based on .NET Core 1.1 and the Full Framework version is based on .NET Framework 4.7 by default. These can be changed if required.
