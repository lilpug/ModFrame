how to update the installer
---------------------------

Note: the build.ps1 script also generates new .vstemplates!
Info: all the projects have been seperated out as when launching in one solution npm, bower and nuget reinstall all the
      files being removed by the powershell script.

STEPS:-

load the installer project

right click on the project and select build

*NOTE: the installer project runs the build.ps1 script before building the vsix installer*
